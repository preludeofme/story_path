I'm working on building a web app using nextjs 13, mui 5, typescript for the purpose of making a choose your own adventure book where the user will see a book on the screen and they will be able to turn the pages by dragging the pages left and right. I have a working example that is written in html and javascript but it is not formatted well and is not maintainable. I've been working on refactoring and converting it to typescript. here's my current problem:

i've got the app rendering, however, right now all pages are being displayed and they're just on top of each other, instead of showing only 2 pages at a time (left and right page). There also is no animation, i've confirmed the drag events are running and the calculation function is running. can you help identify a solution?
